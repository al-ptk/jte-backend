# jte-backend

## Why no typescript?

Not going to use typescript here just to practice other stuff (it's been a while doing node). I will use ts on the Ideas backend.

## Where are the views?

It is in the other project (json-table-editor). It does fetch calls to this backend.

## Special thanks to:

- [This article by Obielum Godson](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/api-authentication-with-json-web-tokensjwt-and-passport) that taught me about Schema.pre hooks and how to use the schemas in a more powerfull way.
- [This article by Digamber](https://www.positronx.io/using-npm-bcryptjs-package-to-hash-password-in-node/) that taught me a cool way of writing a custom error handler middleware on Express.
